# Statistics for Norwegian (bokm√•l) Wikipedia.

This is a slightly edited copy of Zachtes statistics [Monthly counts &amp; Quarterly rankings: December 2016](https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaNO.htm). The table is created by selecting the actual rows from the table, and then copying the _code_  for those rows. A header and footer is recreated, numbers for table cells corrected, and some confusing additions removed. It is then imported into LibreOffice Calc, and sorted in ascending order. Each data column are then moved into separate sheets together with a copy of the date column.

Two columns are then added for _stdDev_ and _mean_, each accumulated over 12 months. By accumulating over one year most of the effects from hollidays are removed. The year is accumulated up to the last month in the year. Note that this will give a delayed skew because it is a plain moving average, and the standard deviation will be slightly higher than expected. Still this is statistically correct.

A third column is then added for lower bound of one standard deviation, aka the 34/68 % limit, and a fourth colum for a one year difference over the mean. Even if the delayed skew is notable for the mean the difference should be pretty close to the expected for stable values.

The graphs is a plain mapping of the column values.
